# Team task I: Feature discovery [20 mins]
***
- List down features you expect from your assigned software system.
    - Milestone 1: At least **2*n** features where n = |{team members}|
    - Today: Try hard to have 2*n but less is OK.
- For each feature
    - Title
    - User story in the form:
  
  `As a [type of user], I want/need [a feature] so that/because [I can/need to achieve some value/benefit/objective]`.


# Team task II: Feature classification [5 mins]
***
- For MVP, categorize features into core and auxiliary features.
  - Milestone 1:
    - Put at least **n** features into the core category.
    - Explain the rationale behind your selection.
  - Today: At least one core feature.

# Team task III: Features breakdown [25 mins]
***
- For each core feature, outline step-by-step what happens when a user uses the feature. This includes:
  - Interaction with the user
  - Getting inputs into and providing outputs from the system
  - Technicalities (storage, communication, audit logging, etc.) and computations behind the scenes
- It is much work but try to analyze at least one core feature today.

# Team task IV: Identify responsibilities [25 min]
***
- **Responsibility**
  - Refers to a specific task, action, or function that a software system or its part must perform to fulfill or implement one or more features.
- **Business responsibility**
  - collect a measurement, notify a nurse, validate the medical history of a patient, and show the nurse responsible for a patient
- **Technical responsibility**
  - store patient update into the database, present patient details in UI
- **Quality responsibility**
  - monitor the availability of some part of the system, authorize a user requirement, balance client requests among multiple machines, and audit log a notification

# Homework
***
- Complete the list of **2*n** features
- Complete the **n** core features, for each
  - user story
  - break down
  - responsibilities
- Document the core features and responsibilities
  - structure the document based on the example `NSWI130_02_P_identification_of_responsibilities OUTPUT.md`
  - put the document into your repo
