## 3. Enroll to course **(CORE)**

* **Who**: Student
* **What**: enroll yourself
* **Why**: To be officially enrolled in a currently offered course (or on a waiting list)

As a student, teacher, or admin, I want to enroll myself or a specified student into a course so that I can officially register for the course (or be added to a waiting list if capacity is exceeded), ensuring proper access to course materials and tracking.

### Feature breakdown

1. The user navigates to the course view page (e.g., via course discovery or a direct link) and selects the "Enroll" option.
2. The system checks the user's authentication and authorization details from the current session to determine eligibility (e.g., verifying if the user is a current student).

6. The system performs additional checks on the selected ticket, including capacity availability, schedule conflicts with the enrollee's existing timetable, and any overlaps with other courses.
7. Based on the validation outcomes:

   * If all checks pass, the system enrolls the student by updating the course roster in the persistence layer, assigns them to the ticket, and logs the action for auditing.
   * If capacity is exceeded, the system adds the student to a waiting list and notifies them.
   * If mandatory checks fail, the system displays an error message with details.
   * If non-mandatory checks (e.g., minor warnings) fail, the system shows a warning but allows proceeding if the user confirms.

8. The system refreshes the user's dashboard or course view, displaying a success notification, updated enrollment status, and any relevant outputs (e.g., confirmation email or updated timetable).
9. Behind the scenes, the system updates related records (e.g., credit counts, waiting list positions) and ensures data consistency across modules like course management and student profiles.

* **Who**: student
* **What**: find courses needed to be taken to fulfill general and/or specific study requirements
* **Why**: to have all left mandatory courses in one place, to check the current state of one's study
plan

As a student, I want to know which mandatory courses, including for my specification, I have left to be able 
to reliably plan for my future schedule. I also want to figure out how many credit I have to obtain to finish
my studies and which areas these credits belong to.

**idea**: All of that should be interactive and plannable. The user should be able to enter 'plan mode' to pick
certain remaining courses and see the updated remaining required credits. 

### Featutes breakdown

1. The student navigates to the "Remaining Duties" module from the main dashboard or a dedicated menu.
2. The system authenticates the student’s session and retrieves their profile, including major, specialization (if applicable), and current study progress from the persistence layer.
3. The system queries the persistence layer to fetch:

   * Mandatory courses required for the student’s major and specialization.
   * Minimum credit requirements for degree completion.
   * The student’s completed courses and earned credits.

4. The system calculates the difference between required and completed courses/credits, identifying remaining mandatory courses and credit deficits.
5. The system displays a detailed view showing:

   * A list of remaining mandatory courses with details (e.g., course code, title, credits, unsatisfied prerequisites).
   * Total remaining credits needed, broken down by category (e.g., major, specialization, electives).
   * Specialization-specific elective groups with their own "out-of" credit requirements and suggested courses.

6. The student can click a course to view its detailed page (e.g., description, prerequisites) via 'View a Course'
feature

   * Visual cues (e.g., color-coded fields) show whether credit requirements are met.

8. The student can save the plan by clicking "Save Choices," which stores the configuration in the persistence layer,
overwriting any previous plan.
9. If the student clicks "Disable Plan Mode," the system discards unsaved changes and returns to the standard
Remaining Duties view.
