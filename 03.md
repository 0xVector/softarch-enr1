# Practicals 3: Drafting architecture based on high cohesion and low coupling

## Task 2: Architecture decomposition

| **Name** | ***Course visualization*** | ***Course management***  | ***Communication*** |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| UI (Presentation) | - view a course <br>- view all courses <br>- view dashboard <br>- view course totals <br>- view featured courses <br>- display historical stats <br>- display surveys  | choose a ticket <br>- ticket overflow notification <br>- course enrolled notification <br>- display planning mode | - view chat <br>- view contacts <br>- view chat history |
| **Business / Application**  | - filter courses <br>- search courses <br>- select featured courses | - validate ticket <br>- course & ticket enrollment <br>- plan mode validation <br>- plan mode feedback | - process messages <br>- notify users about incoming messages <br>- online status |
| **Persistence / Infrastructure** | - retrieve data about all courses <br>- store course data <br>- allow querying with filters <br>- retrieve statistics <br>- data caching | - course data retrieval <br>- ticket data retrieval <br>- log and audit <br>- student profile manager <br>- study progress manager <br>- store plan | - get conversation history <br>- store conversation history |

***course management = $(course en/un rollment, management of studentâ€™s courses & requirement)***

## Task 3: Identify dependencies
![Diagram](03-diagram.png)

## Homework

- Continue with decomposition and identifying dependencies for all core features and all their responsibilities
    - The final architecture must cover **n*(10-20)** responsibilities for **n** core features.
- Start documenting the architecture using the C4 model
    - Depending on when you have your consultation.
- For your first consultation, you must prepare the first version of your architecture.
    - It will not be perfect.
    - It will not be final.
    - We will iterate (merge, split, reorganize, reconnect, ...)
