# Practicals 3: Drafting architecture based on high cohesion and low coupling

## Task 2: Architecture decomposition

| **Name** | ***Course visualization*** | ***Course management***  | ***Communication*** | **Survey management**
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| UI (Presentation) | - view a course <br>- view all courses <br>- view dashboard <br>- view course totals <br>- view featured courses <br>- display historical stats <br>- display surveys  | choose a ticket <br>- ticket overflow notification <br>- course enrolled notification <br>- display planning mode | - view chat <br>- view contacts <br>- view chat history | - survey view <br> - survey filter handler <br> - survey form handler
| **Business / Application**  | - filter courses <br>- search courses <br>- select featured courses | - validate ticket <br>- course & ticket enrollment <br>- plan mode validation <br>- plan mode feedback | - process messages <br>- notify users about incoming messages <br>- online status | - survey-taker validation <br> - survey form validator <br> - manage survey interactions
| **Persistence / Infrastructure** | - retrieve data about all courses <br>- store course data <br>- allow querying with filters <br>- allow querying course details <br>- retrieve statistics <br>- data caching <br>- user role authorization | - course data retrieval <br>- ticket data retrieval <br>- log and audit <br>- student profile manager <br>- study progress manager <br>- store plan <br>- user role authorization | - get conversation history <br>- store conversation history | - survey store <br> - survey fetch <br> - survey persistence layer <br> - deleted surveys storage && handler <br>

***course management = $(course en/un rollment, management of studentâ€™s courses & requirement)***

## Task 3: Identify dependencies
![Diagram](03-diagram.png)

## Homework

- Continue with decomposition and identifying dependencies for all core features and all their responsibilities
    - The final architecture must cover `n*(10-20)` responsibilities for `n` core features.
- Start documenting the architecture using the C4 model
    - Depending on when you have your consultation.
- For your first consultation, you must prepare the first version of your architecture.
    - It will not be perfect.
    - It will not be final.
    - We will iterate (merge, split, reorganize, reconnect, ...)
